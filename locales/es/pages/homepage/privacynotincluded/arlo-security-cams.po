"Arlo security cameras include the standard indoor and outdoor models with HD video, two-way talk, and motion detection. And recently they added an indoor security cam with what they call \"privacy "
"shield\" wihich is an automated features that covers the camera when you tell it to. They also sell a video camera that works over cellular data designed to be taken anywhere for mobile "
"surveillance. Which, yeah, sounds kinda creepy. All in all, Arlo's security cams allow for a whole lot of watching, which is what they are designed to do. Their Arlo Secure subscriptions are "
"required to give you things like cloud storage, theft protection, and the Plus plan gets you 24/7 emergency response."

"We kinda love Arlo for a few reasons. First off, on International Privacy Day in 2019 they proudly <a id=\"a1\">proclaimed</a> they will not share or sell or monetize their users' data in any way. "
"It was a bit of a dig at Amazon’s Ring--who was in the midst of dealing with a number of public privacy concerns. We'll take some trolling of Ring to get great user privacy protections from Arlo. "
"Another thing we kinda love about Arlo is they are honest about privacy on the internet. We wish more companies had this sort of honesty in their <a id=\"a2\">privacy policy</a>, \"While we use "
"reasonable and appropriate security measures, the Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the "
"Internet.\" Yes! We also encourage you to always use caution when using the internet."

"While Arlo does seem to take your privacy seriously, and hopefully they do as much work behind the scenes as they do with their PR around that, these are still video cams that record video to the "
"Cloud on the internet, so be careful. Arlo does collect a bit of your personal information — standard things like name, email, and product usage data. This is of no great concern to us. They do say "
"that if you access your Arlo account with a Facebook login, they might collect more personal information. Facebook also might collect more personal information on you too. Please don’t access your "
"accounts with your Facebook login people, it’s just not a smart privacy decision."
