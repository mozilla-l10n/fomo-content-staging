"If you're one of those people who run and hide in the closet when a stranger knocks on your door, these video doorbells from Arlo (or any video doorbell, really) are for you! There's a wired one and"
" a slightly more expensive wireless battery powered one. Check the HD video with night vision and 180 degree viewing angle to see if there's a crazy guy with a hatchet at your front door. If there "
"is, use the two-way audio to let him know you've called the cops. Get a phone alert when the motion sensor trips as he creeps around again. Then blast the built-in siren on the doorbell from your "
"phone to scare hatchet guy away for good. Just one real-world scenario of how things could go down if you own the Arlo Video Doorbell."

"We kinda love Arlo for a few reasons. First off, on International Privacy Day in 2019 they proudly <a id=\"a1\">proclaimed</a> they will not share or sell or monetize their users' data in any way. "
"It was a bit of a dig at Amazon’s Ring--who was in the midst of dealing with a number of public privacy concerns. We'll take some trolling of Ring to get great user privacy protections from Arlo. "
"Another thing we kinda love about Arlo is they are honest about privacy on the internet. We wish more companies had this sort of honesty in their <a id=\"a2\">privacy policy</a>, \"While we use "
"reasonable and appropriate security measures, the Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the "
"Internet.\" Yes! We also encourage you to always use caution when using the internet."

"While Arlo does seem to take your privacy seriously, and hopefully they do as much work behind the scenes as they do with their PR around that, these are still video cams that record video to the "
"Cloud on the internet, so be careful. Arlo does collect a bit of your personal information — standard things like name, email, and product usage data. This is of no great concern to us. They do say "
"that if you access your Arlo account with a Facebook login, they might collect more personal information. Facebook also might collect more personal information on you too. Please don’t access your "
"accounts with your Facebook login people, it’s just not a smart privacy decision."
