"This smart thermostat has five questions for you, including when you get up, when you leave for work, when you get home, and when you go to bed. Answer them, and you’re on your way never having to "

"We love that Netatmo seems to take privacy and security seriously. It’s a great thing to see from makers of smart thermostats. What’s the worst that could happen? Well, we suppose someone could "
"learn the answers to the five questions your smart thermostat asked you. Get to know your schedule too well. Know when you’re away from home and use that to time their break in to steal your TV. "
"They could also learn that same information from watching your house or following you on social media, so, yeah, this smart thermostat probably isn’t the greatest threat to your privacy. Still, it's"
" good to be aware."
