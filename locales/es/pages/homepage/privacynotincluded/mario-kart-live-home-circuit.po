"Mario Kart is super fun! Crushing your friends at the last minute before you cross the finish like, there's nothing better. Nintendo created Mario Kart Live Home Circuit so you can do a little real-"
"life Mario Kart racing in your living room. Build a racing course in your house out of gates, blocks, pillows, stuffed animals or your little brother. Then use your Nintendo Switch to race a real "
"life car around your house and on your Switch. Sounds super fun. There were some privacy questions raised when the game was launched about the cars taking picture and mapping your home. Nintendo "
"promises they don't take detailed maps of users homes or process information about users' locations. Given Nintendo's pretty good track record around all things privacy, we'd say you're probably "
"safe to trust them."

"Last year after Nintendo released their mixed reality game Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit it raised some privacy concerns. The game uses a real-life car to play and that car drives around your home, "
"mapping it and taking pictures. Privacy watchdog <a id=\"a1\">Access Now called on Nintendo</a> to clearly state what data the game collects and how it will protect the privacy of gamers who play "
"this game. Here is Nintendo's response to Access Now's privacy concerns: “Nintendo knows that privacy is very important to its customers and takes its responsibility to protect customer information "
"seriously. Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit does not create detailed maps of users’ homes, nor does it collect or process information about a user’s location, home or surroundings. Any other reports "
"that describe the technology as collecting this or similar information are incorrect.”"

"It’s also good to be aware that while Nintendo doesn't sell your data to third parties, they do say they can share your data with some third parties for things such as advertising, which is pretty "
"normal. They also say they may collect information about you from other sources, including sources that sell information. And if you log into your social media through your Nintendo, they say they "
"may collect information from these third parties. Finally, some of the games you play on the Switch made by other companies might be collecting and sharing your data, so keep an eye on that. It’s "
"always good to <a id=\"a1\">opt out of data sharing</a> when you can. All in all, we’re not too worried about the privacy of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, so race away."
