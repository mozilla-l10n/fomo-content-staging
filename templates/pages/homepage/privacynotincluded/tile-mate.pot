"These little doohickies attach to just about anything: your pet, wallet, keys, TV remote, bags, other people’s bags. The app lets you track your things within Bluetooth range and rings where they "

"Tile joined with Amazon Sidewalk to offer even more tracking to these trackers for users in the US by using Amazon Echo and Ring devices in the community to help track your Tile. Yeah, it might be a"

"Tile is the OG maker of Bluetooth trackers. So this year when Apple came out with their Airtags, Tile had to do their best to keep up. Apple could tap into their vast Find My network of <a "
"id=\"a1\">nearly a billion Apple devices</a> to make Airtag locating just about anywhere a reality. In response, Airtag joined up with <a id=\"a2\">Amazon Sidewalk</a> to <a id=\"a3\">expand their "
"community network</a> (at least in the US, Amazon Sidewalk doesn’t work outside the US) to all those supported Echo and Ring devices out there in the world, seriously expanding their locating "
"network. Fortunately, so far the privacy and security of Amazon Sidewalk looks promising <a id=\"a4\">according to privacy watchdog EFF</a>."
