"Let's be honest, Facebook has a pretty terrible track record when it comes to protecting their user's privacy (remember that record $5 billion dollar fine for privacy failures?). Now they're asking "
"people to drop a couple hundred dollars to put a device with an AI-powered smart camera capable of tracking your every move and an Alexa-powered, always listening microphone in your home. What could"
" go wrong? Given Facebook's terrible track record on privacy, we're worried a lot."

"collecting? From <a id=\"a2\">Cambridge Analytica</a> to where we are today, the answer to that question is a resounding NO. We're afraid this device comes with *privacy not included."

"Facebook says it does not sell any of your information to anyone, and never will. However, it shares data with numerous third parties such as partners who use their analytics services, advertisers, "
"measurement partners, partners offering goods and services in Facebook products, vendors and service providers, researchers and academics, law enforcement, and legal requests. Facebook says that it "
"does not use voice data for targeted ads. However, the metadata about your Portal usage – how often you make video calls or use in-call apps or features – can be used to target you with "
"advertisements across the Facebook advertisement network. In addition, Facebook collects personal data from its partners. These partners provide information about your activities off Facebook — "
"including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services—whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged into "
"Facebook. Facebook shares information it collects on Portal with independent apps and services that integrate with Portal. This may include information about a user’s Portal device, such as device "
"name, IP address, and zip code, as well as other information to help them provide the services requested by the user (for example, the text and subject of their voice commands to the app, service or"
" integration through “Hey Portal”). The information collected by these independent apps, services, or integrations is subject to their own terms and policies."
