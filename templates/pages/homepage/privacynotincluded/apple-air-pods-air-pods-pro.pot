"Apple does a pretty good job with privacy and security as a company. They say they don't share or sell your data and Apple takes special care to make sure your Siri requests aren't associated with "
"you, which is great. Apple did face backlash in 2019 when it came to light their contractors were regularly listening in on confidential personal conversations when they were reviewing the voice "
"assistant's recordings. Apple changed their policy so users weren't automatically opted-in to human voice review. Recently, Apple made another <a id=\"a1\">positive change</a> for your Siri voice "
"requests — many audio requests for things like setting timers or alarms or controlling music will no longer be sent over the internet to their servers, instead processing them directly on the "
"device. This is better for your privacy."

"Apple had a recent serious security vulnerability. From <a id=\"a1\">Firewall Times</a>: \"In September 2021, researchers discovered that a spyware called Pegasus had infected iPhones and other "
"Apple Devices via a ‘zero click exploit’, granting the spyware broad power over a users’ device. Once infected, the spyware could record calls and messages and even turn the device camera and "
"microphone on without the user knowing. Pegasus was produced by the NSO Group, an Israel-based company that sells its spyware to governments such as Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Though this spyware "
"would presumably be used to surveil terrorists and criminal enterprises, these governments have also used it to spy on activists, politicians, and journalists. As of September 13, 2021, Apple has "
