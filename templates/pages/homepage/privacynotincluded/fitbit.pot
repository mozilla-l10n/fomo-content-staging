"Update: In June 2022, after Roe vs Wade was overturned allowing US states to make access to abortion illegal, we took another look at the privacy and security of Google's Ftibit fitness trackers "
"that can track menstrual cycle data. Our updated review is below. Overall, Fitbit is owned by Google, for better and for worse. That means your data is owned by the advertising giant (although not "
"used for advertising, according to them). It also means Google has the resources to push back against law enforcement requests for data if they chose."

"As of January 14, 2021, Google officially <a id=\"a1\">became the owner</a> of Fitbit. That worried many privacy conscious users. However, Google promised that “Fitbit users’ health and wellness "
"data won't be used for Google ads and this data will be kept separate from other Google ad data” as part of the deal with global regulators when they bought Fitbit. This is good."

"And Fitbit seems to do an OK job with privacy and security. It de-identifies the data it collects so it's (hopefully) not personally identifiable. We say hopefully because, depending on the kind of "
"data, it’s <a id=\"a1\">been found</a> to be pretty easy to de-anonymize these data sets and track down an individual’s patterns, especially with location data. So, be aware with Fitbit—or any "

"What is not good is what can happen with all this very personal health data if others aren't careful. A recent <a id=\"a1\">report</a> showed that health data for over 61 million fitness tracker "
"users, including both Fitbit and Apple, was exposed when a third-party company that allowed users to sync their health data from their fitness trackers did not secure the data properly. Personal "
"information such as names, birthdates, weight, height, gender, and geographical location for Fitbit and other fitness-tracker users was left exposed because the company didn't password protect or "
"encrypt their database. This is a great reminder that yes, while Fitbit might do a good job with their own security, anytime you sync or share that data with anyone else, it could be vulnerable. And"
" Fitbit partners with many third parties such as employers and insurance companies. I don’t know about you, but I don’t need the world to know my weight and where I live. That’s really dang creepy."
