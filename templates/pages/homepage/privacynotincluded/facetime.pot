"If you've ever video chatted iPhone-to-iPhone, chances are you used FaceTime. Apple's video call app comes installed on its devices by default, meaning FaceTime options get prime placement. FaceTime"
" is super simple, making it easy to access features like mute and flip camera. The biggest downside? The FaceTime club is an exclusive one — if you don't have an Apple device, you can't join. "
"However, that will change soon when the iOS 15 release happens in Fall, 2021. That Apple software update will allow Android and Windows users to open a Facetime link in a browser. Maybe not the best"
" video call experience, but, you know, Apple likes to keep things in their own ecosystem."

"Not too much, we think (hope!). Apple is known for having a pretty strong security and privacy track record, at least compared to many of the other Big Tech companies. FaceTime is end-to-end "
"encrypted, which is the best case scenario for a video chat app. And Apple doesn't share your data with third-parties, which is nice. There was a pretty nasty Facetime bug found back in 2019 that "
"let users call somebody through FaceTime and listen in on the phone’s microphone whether or not the person answered the call. Apple fixed that bug quickly. FaceTime makes a fine video call option "
"(if all your friends own Apple products)."

"The bug, discovered in January 2019, allowed eavesdropping of the calls and videos. It transmitted audio to a caller despite the recipient not having accepted the call. It was triggered when the "
"initial caller added a third person to a FaceTime call. If the person being called pressed the power button on their lock screen as a call came in, video from their phone would also be sent to the "
"caller without the user’s knowledge. Apple has quickly fixed the bug, and disabled group calling feature before it was fixed."
