"Eufy's line of video doorbells--they sell both wired and battery powered version at 2K and 1080p resolutions--keep it all in house. They don't offer a cloud storage subscription, only local storage."
" Which, for the privacy conscious homeowner who wants a video doorbell but doesn't want video from that doorbell living in the cloud where hackers, law enforcement, or who knows else could access "
"it, is a good thing. Eufy also let's you access your locally stored footage from anywhere and uses strong encryption to protect it in transmission. Otherwise, these video doorbells do what all the "
"others do--HD video, motion detection, two-way audio, and they work with both Alexa and Google Assistant. Hey, sometimes keeping it all at home is the best--and most private--option."

"Earlier this year, your intrepid <i>*Privacy Not Included</i> researcher decided she needed some indoor security cams to help keep an eye on her beloved kitty while on a trip for a couple of nights."
" Being a privacy researcher, the one feature she wanted in her security cams was that all video captured be stored locally, not in the less secure cloud. And so, she purchased Eufy’s security cams "
"for that feature and because they do a good job, in general, protecting personal data. What’s her verdict so far? No regrets at all. These Eufy cams make spying on the kitty about as worry free as "
"possible."

"We really like that your security cam footage is stored locally, not in the much less secure cloud. You can access your videos at any time through the Eufy app, and that footage is protected by "
"strong encryption in transit and where it is stored. This is all very cool."

"Eufy also doesn't sell your personal data, which is cool. Eufy does collect information on you and uses that informaiton to show you ads for them and third parties, which isn’t super cool but also "
"isn't unsual. Eufy's AI detects body shape and face pattern to provide alerts you of humans at your front door, not racoons. One key value of Eufy's local storage is that all AI analyses are done "
"locally, which ensures privacy and is usually much quicker than cloud-based analyses."

"Unfortunately, Eufy isn’t perfect. In <a id=\"a1\">May 2021</a>, Eufy was forced to <a id=\"a2\">apologize</a> for a bug that exposed the <a id=\"a3\">camera feeds</a> of 712 users to strangers. "
"Eufy said the glitch happened during a software update and “users were able to access video feeds from other users’ cameras.” Eufy said in a <a id=\"a4\">statement</a> the glitch was fixed an hour "
"after it was discovered. This is pretty much the worst case scenario for security cam users. Fortunately, Eufy identified and fixed this privacy nightmare quickly. And so, this is a good time to "
"remind folks that anything accessed on the internet isn’t ever 100% safe. Even the good companies screw up."
