"Hallow is a Catholic prayer and meditation app launched at the end of 2018. A $60 per year subscription (or $8.99 per month) gives users access to over 500 prayers, 3,500+ meditations, sleep Bible "
"stories, music, sermons, and more. At the end of 2021, Hallow announced <a id=\"a1\">investor funding</a> of over $50 million dollars from some big names in <a id=\"a2\">Silicon Valley venture "
"capital</a>, including Peter Thiel, who recently<a id=\"a3\"> left Facebook/Meta's</a> board to become more involved in politics, supporting candidates who align with Donald Trump's agenda. All in "
"all, Hallow's privacy practices seem to be the best of the five pray apps we reviewed, although they do use users' data for marketing purposes. Hallow seems to particularly be fond of <a "
"id=\"a4\">advertising on Facebook</a>."

"So, how does Hallow's privacy practices look? They say they collect personal information, including name, email, phone number, gender (inferred based on your name), and IP address, as well as things"
" like app usage data, prayer minutes, and the text of personal journal entries. Some of this personal data (not private sensitive personal data like your journal entries) they say they can use for "
"targeted interest-based and behavioral advertising, which we don't love. And they do say they can share data with a number of third parties, including advertising and marketing partners which, "
"again, we don't love."

"secure their app. Hallow also says they will be adding text-message verification code sign up soon too, which is great, as we like <a id=\"a1\">two-factor authentication</a> here at <i>*Privacy Not "

"What's the worst that could happen. Well, you could download and use Hallow and before you know it, you and all your friends and family now see targeted Hallow ads everywhere you go. Soon the guilt "
"sets in that you're not using your Hallow prayer app enough because life got busy. Now you feel like you need to go ask your priest for forgiveness. Three Hail Mary's later and you're all good. "
"Here's hoping that doesn't happen...or that really is the worst thing that happens."
