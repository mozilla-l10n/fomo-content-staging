"BlueJeans is a video call app aimed at business users. It works on desktop and mobile apps and within most browsers. This video call app claims a list of features like high-quality video, screen "
"sharing, recording, and integration with various other business apps like Trello and Slack. BlueJeans even touts that it comes with “Dolby Voice,” so now you can listen to your boss yell at you in "
"super clear audio. In May, 2020 Verizon closed their deal to buy BlueJeans. Can you hear us now? Hopefully."

"BlueJeans seems to do an OK job with security and privacy. A month after they were acquired by Verizon in 2020 they rolled out a number of enhanced security measures including stronger encryption "
"and one-click meeting lock capabilities. Bluejeans doesn't use end-to-end encryption (data encrypted from the moment it is created to the moment it is used), which is the most secure way to conduct "
"video calls. But it still uses strong encryption at transit (along the tubes of the internet) and at rest (where it is stored). It does collect some personal information about users like your name, "
"who you work for, your job, where you live, your phone number and email address, and potentially shares that data with third parties, which we don't love, but also isn’t uncommon. Bluejeans rolled "
"out Bluejeans Telehealth earlier in 2021 that can be HIPAA compliant. All in all, Bluejeans is a fine video call app for business, even if it does have a weird name that makes you sing Neil Diamond "
"songs."
