"Nope. That's the first word that comes to mind after researching this period and fertility tracking app made by India-based Plackal Tech. There is not a privacy or security ding we didn't assign to "
"this period and fertilizing tracking app that says it makes tracking periods fun and easy. Free to download, Maya has some premium features users have to pay that cost around $4 a year. Maya tracks "
"all sorts of things like sexual activity, period frequency, weight, body temperature, period symptoms, mood, and more. Unfortunately, Maya has a spotty track record of protecting all this very "
"personal data it collects on their users. 2019 research by <a id=\"a1\">Privacy International found</a> they shared lots of this personal, health information with Facebook. Yuck. That's the second "
"word that comes to mind now when we think of this app."

"Things your privacy researchers really don't like about Maya's period and fertility tracking app. One, they bury their privacy policy in their Terms of Service doc, making it really hard for an "
"average person to find. Boo! Two, consent to use your personal information for the all the purposes they want seems to comes when you visit the platform and/or provide your information. Users might "
"not realize they've given consent simply by doing those things. And there there is this gem mentioned in their privacy policy that raises eyebrows when it comes to consent, \"You acknowledge and "
"agree that even if You are not a registered User with Us, We may collect information about You, if a registered User has provided Us with Your information to facilitate services.\" Yuck!"

"Three, while they do say they won't share personal information about identifiable individuals to advertisers, they do say they do say they can share aggregate and/or anonymised information \"to help"
" advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target\" And they make use information the collect on you \"to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that "
"target audience.\" Maya goes on to say they can share users' information with sponsors, and/or business partners to send \"newsletters, offers, information about new services, and other "
"information.\" So, your information is potentially being shared with a fair amount of third parties and advertisers to reach you with more offers and even targeted ads. That's not so great."

"Four, we also ding Maya because they don't mention any data retention details in their privacy policy. They do say users can delete their information from the app though, so if you use this app, "

"Maya doesn't meet our Minimum Security Standards for a couple of reasons. First, they allow the super duper weak password of \"1\" to login to their app. Very bad form. And two, because we just "

"But really, the worst thing Maya has done when it comes to protecting and respecting their user's privacy is when <a id=\"a1\">Privacy International discovered</a> in 2019 that they were sharing "
"some VERY personal information of their users with Facebook. <a id=\"a2\">BuzzFeed News reported</a> Privacy International found Maya shared user data such as when a user last had sex, their use of "
"contraception, the timing of their periods, their moods, and what symptoms they had such as cramping and swelling. Ick! Uhg! Bad! The report also found some data was being shared with Facebook even "
"before a user had the change to agree to the app's privacy policy. When called out about sharing all this data, Maya responded by pointing out they it doesn't share any personally identifiable data "
"with Facebook. Yeah, no. This is data that should never be shared with Facebook, ever. It also <a id=\"a3\">seems like data</a> that wouldn't be super hard to re-identify."

"Given all these knocks against Maya — they collect a metric ton of very personal information, they share that information with lots of places, they don't tell users how long they can retain that "
"information, they only require a very weak password of \"1\" and don't meet our Minimum Security Standards, and they have a pretty bad track record of protecting their user's personal information, "
"we'd say there is a whole lot that could go wrong if you use this app to track your periods and fertilizing. We have to say, Maya almost certainly comes with *Privacy Not Included."
