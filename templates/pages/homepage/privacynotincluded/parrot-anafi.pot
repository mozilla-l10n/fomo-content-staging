"In years past when we reviewed consumer drones, too many of them had poor privacy and security. That's why it's nice to see Parrot’s Anafi drone take real steps to protect users' privacy. Parrot "
"makes their drone with “<a id=\"a1\">privacy by design</a>”, which means they do things like only processing relevant data, not collecting much data on users to begin with, and only sharing any "
"personal data to third parties with your express consent. They also encrypt all photos and videos stored on the device’s SD card with strong encryption."

"spy on your neighbors in their backyard, that would be rude. Other than that, we aren’t too worried about what could go wrong with this little drone from Parrot."
