"Sonos took their Sonos One smart speaker and made it dumb. Seems there is a market for privacy-minded people who just want a speaker for playing music, not with a built-in microphone that could be "
"spying on you. This Sonos One SL is just like the Sonos One minus the microphone listening for Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant commands. Control it with the Sonos app over WiFi, not Bluetooth, or "
"use Apple Airplay to stream your music. To think, a speaker simply built to play music and not listen to you all day long. Crazy!"

"other. To be fair, we've all probably made a mistake like that so we'll cut them a little slack. All in all, there’s not a lot that can go wrong with this speaker in your house because it’s, well, "
"it’s really just a speaker. One more thing. If you decide to use Sonos Radio, a $7.99 subscription service that plays you curated music and lets you tune into over 60,000 radio stations around the "
"world, Sonos will share some anonymized data with third party advertisers for internet based ads. This isn't a huge deal though, so we're not too worried about it."
