"This app is confusing. Well, maybe the app itself isn't confusing, but trying to work out who makes this app and what their privacy policy is, yeah, that's confusing. Which doesn't bode too well for"
" an app with over 100 million downloads in the Google Play store alone. This app is either made by a company called <a id=\"a1\">Simple Design</a> or a company called <a id=\"a2\">Abishkking</a>, or"
" perhaps both. The websites are the same stock-photo-filled basic sites with different names. Good luck finding a privacy policy anywhere on either one of them though. To scavenge for the privacy "
"policy you'll have to go the app page on the <a id=\"a3\">Google</a> or <a id=\"a4\">Apple</a> apps stores. And even then, you end up in different places. There's the <a id=\"a5\">privacy policy</a>"
" linked on the Google Play store, and then the Apple App store actually links to <a id=\"a6\">two</a> different privacy <a id=\"a7\">policies</a>. Like we said, confusing."

"Confusion aside, what does this app do? Well, it says it can track and predict your period, ovulation, and fertility window, tell you your chance of getting pregnant every day, and record intimacy, "
"and \"and everything about women who try to conceive, pregnant, or birth control.\" We're not exactly sure what all that everything is, but it sure sounds like it's collecting a whole lot of very "
"personal information. So, how does it look from a privacy perspective? Well, again, we'd say, kinda confusing and probably not too good."

"We ding this app for a number of reasons. First, they do collect a whole lot of very personal information. And although they say they won't share the personal information you track in the app, they "
"do say they can share personal information about your visits to the app with third parties for marketing and interest-based advertising. That's not great. Advertisers might not know when your period"
" is or how long, but they can tell you're using this period tracking app and your location and more. You probably don't want that."

"We also ding this app because while they say they don't sell your personal information, they clearly state in their privacy policy that some of the service providers they partner with might sell it."
" \"We do not sell personal information. However, the Service Providers we partner with (for example, our advertising partners) may use technology on the Service that \"sells\" personal information "
"as defined by the <a id=\"a1\">CCPA law</a>.\" In fact, In May, 2022 a <a id=\"a2\">reporter for Motherboard</a> found data for sale on a data broker site including data related to this app. That's "

"This app earns a third privacy ding from us because we could find no clear rights for all users to access and delete their data. We strongly feel, especially with apps that track period and "

"Oh, and how does the company say they handle law enforcement requests for your data? Well, that's addressed in their privacy policy with the rather vague line, \"Under certain circumstances, the "
"Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).\" For a company that "
"appears to be quite small, and we're even confused about which company actually makes this app, we don't get the sense they would be able to fight back against law enforcement requests for personal "
"data on their users. Which, again, in the post-Roe vs Wade world in the US, is another concern for us."

"What's the worst that could happen? Oh man, the potential scenarios feel scary. It does seem possible that a women could download and use the app. Have her very personal, private period history "
"tracked. Some third party service provider could gather some bits of this information that could then be sold and end up in the hands of data brokers. Someone else could purchase that data and learn"
" about a device ID, location, and other information about that user. Potentially combine that data with other data the includes device ID and location and learn the woman's identity. And from there,"
" it could only get worse. This is a scenario, we don't know if it could happen. But we think potential users of this app should be aware that it's not outside the realm of possibility."
