"WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world with around 2 billion (yes, billion) users worldwide. The app is encrypted by default with end-to-end encryption for both messages and"

" it comes to video, WhatsApp allows for one-on-one calls and group calling with up to eight people. Just beware, WhatsApp has had a pretty well known misinformation problem and well, misinformation "

"Facebook-owned WhatsApp caused quite the kerfuffle early in 2021 when it complained about Apple’s app store privacy labels that show all the data an app links to you. It didn’t look good for "
"WhatsApp, especially when Apple published the same info for their iMessage app. Then WhatsApp updated their privacy policy in a way that scared the pants off people, justified or not, which caused a"
" huge jumping ship of WhatsApp users to apps like Telegram and Signal. And then Ireland hit WhatsApp with a record $266 million fine for an alleged lack of transparency over how it shares data with "
"Facebook. So, what’s the deal? Is WhatsApp bad for privacy? From a technical perspective, no, not really. WhatsApp uses super strong end-to-end encryption for all texts, chats, and video calls, This"
" is great! WhatsApp can’t read your messages or see your calls. The flip side of this is Facebook--a company infamous for its vast and questionably ethical collection of so much data--owns WhatsApp."
" This means that lots of metadata, things like purchase history, location, device ID, and more--can be captured and shared with businesses advertising on WhatsApp. People looking for a true privacy-"
"centered messaging app can find better options, like Signal and Threema. Messaging aside, it's worth considering WhatsApp's role in spreading misinformation. In 2020, WhatsApp became such a major "
"source of misinformation about the coronavirus that world leaders called out the app by name. WhatsApp did take steps to try and stop the flood of misinformation when it began limiting the number of"
" times people could pass on frequently forwarded content to five chats at once. Misinformation is a problem these days, one everyone should be aware of and do their best to not make worse."

"There is a complex chain of how data moves between WhatsApp and Facebook Inc., and then to numerous third parties. If you use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses,the Facebook-owned messaging app"

"customize, support, and market our Services.'. This information could be used by Facebook and its other products to make suggestions for you, personalize features and content, help you complete "
"purchases and transactions, and show relevant offers and ads across the Facebook Company Products. Facebook claims to not sell its data, but it shares data with numerous third parties such as "
"partners who use their analytics services, advertisers, measurement partners, partners offering goods and services in Facebook products, vendors and service providers, researchers and academics, law"

"In May 2021, WhatsApp found itself at the center of controversy regarding its privacy policy. The main change was regarding sharing data, including communication content with businesses, with the "
"larger Facebook Group. Many privacy-conscious users thought that ALL their communication data will be shared with Facebook (which is not the case). But it is hard to blame them, since WhatsApp's "
"policy is not an example of a crystal clear one, nor was the process of its implementation soft. WhatsApp has been bombarding users for months with persistent pop-up messages to force them to accept"
" its new terms of use and privacy policy. We too, as millions of WhatsApp users, found it hard to get what exactly is this update changing, looking at the privacy policy and terms of use only. Thus,"
" we consider these documents to be confusing on purpose. Only the purpose is still unclear."
