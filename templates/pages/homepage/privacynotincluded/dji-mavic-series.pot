"DJI’s Mavic Series of drones range from the high-end Mavic 3 with a 28x super zooming HD camera and 46 minutes of flight time to the lower end Mini 2 that only weighs half a pound, fits in the palm "
"of your hand and can fly for 31 minutes. These pricey consumer drones make taking pictures for above with features like 4k video, quick and easy transfer of photos and videos to your smartphone, and"
" the ability to zoom right into your neighbor’s window. Please don’t use these drones to zoom into your neighbor’s window."

"China-based drone maker DJI has <a id=\"a1\">a history</a> of not being good when it comes to privacy and security. <a id=\"a2\">Researchers raised concerns</a> in 2020 about <a "
