"Let’s face it, vacuuming sucks. Throw in some pets or kids and this Sisyphean task can drain your soul. Well, hello Roomba! This robot vacuum does the work for you. These robot vacuums map your "
"house, can tell the kitchen from the dinner room, and will vacuum with a \"Hey Google, clean up under the table\" voice command. A truly wonderful invention. And if you've been scarred by watching "
"those videos where they smear poop all over the floor, you're worries are (hopefully) over. Roombas are learning how to avoid dog poo. Technological advances are a truly a wonder."

"Now it seems the biggest thing you have to worry about with your Roomba is it rolling through dog poo on the floor and creating a huge mess. Oh, wait! The new J series Roombas come with what they "
"call P.O.O.P. (Pet Owner Official Promise). According to the company, the <a id=\"a1\">P.O.O.P promise</a> means certain robot vacuums “will steer clear of your pet’s waste as it gets down to its "
"own business. If it doesn’t, we'll replace your robot for free. (for one year)). Roomba accomplishes this poop detection with a camera and artificial intelligence. Does this <a id=\"a2\">raise some "
"privacy concerns?</a> Yes. We also like all the measures Roomba takes to protect users like only recognizing a few objects (including poo) and shutting the camera off if it detects a human. Still, "
"if the device were hacked, it’s possible those privacy protections could be circumvented."
