"Jitsi Meet is a free, open-source, video call app that doesn't require you to create an account to use it. The privacy conscious folks at the Tor Project recently recommended Jitsi Meet as a good "
"alternative to Zoom. Jitsi Meet works on desktop, Android and iOS devices, has pretty high-quality video and audio, allows for password protected video calls, and has no limit on participants "
"(although your internet bandwidth might set limits for you). And for those more techie folks out there, because Jitsi Meet is open-source, people with the interest and ability can install and run "
"their own version of Jitsi Meet on their own servers. (Note: The review below is for the public version of Jitsi Meet. People who install and run their own versions of Jitsi Meet might not meet all "
"these criteria.)."

"Jitsi Meet and the open-source community behind it appear to value and prioritize privacy and security as part of their mission in making this product. It’s a little hard for us to tell exactly how "
"they are doing in 2021 though because we found the email address they recommend in their privacy policy for questions of their data protection officer no longer works. That’s not good. Jitsi.Meet "
"uses encryption, but it is not quite there yet in terms of full end-to-end encryption by default. Right now, you can only turn on end-to-end encryption if you are using Jitsi Meet on certain "
"browsers (but not on Firefox, boo!). 8x8, the parent company of Jitsi Meet, does collect and share (but not sell) data to third-parties. This is common for many products out there, so it’s not "

"We can see a transparent and detailed communication of all privacy &amp; security aspects of Jitsi. The target audience are rather privacy-oriented folks, but still there is some effort to make the "
"information simpler - which is a challenging task in the security space. We especially appreciate the existence of both detailed technical security architecture whitepaper and the educational paper "
"with an explanation what it means, for people without a degree in InfoSec."
