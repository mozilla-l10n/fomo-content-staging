"Michael Bublé, Kris Jenner, amd others <a id=\"a1\">invested</a> $40 million in this app in 2021, in part to help in <i>\"</i><a id=\"a2\"><i>reimagining</i></a><i> how we connect with God through "
"technology.\"</i> The Glorify app offers daily devotionals, prayers, reflections, biblical meditations, and prayer lists for around $50 for an annual subscription (costs vary according to <a "
"id=\"a3\">their price list</a> on the Apple app store). It's good to remember, the money invested in Glorify by high profile investors is generally because they are hoping to make a profit. As "

"isn’t the product.\"</i> Which sounds great. However, we're not so sure it's true based on what we found in Glorify's privacy policy."

"Glorify's privacy policy clearly states the personal information you provide them is considered a business asset. It also clearly states that while they don't sell your personal information, they "

"get from third-party sources such as gender and birth date and they can use that information to provide you with information about their business, products, and services. Which means they can use "
"all that personal information to try and sell you more stuff."

"In that same TechCrunch interview, Glorfy's co-founder stated, <i>\"I believe the engaged audience that we will have will probably have a higher propensity to pay for all sorts of other products "
