"Since we launched *Privacy Not Included back in 2017, the Nintendo Switch has sat at the top of our list of products users find least creepy. Good on Nintendo for doing a great job with privacy. And"
" for featuring sweet games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Mario, the Legend of Zelda. Good guy Nintendo also puts a lot of emphasis on easy-to-use parental controls. Dear Santa, we've "

"It’s also good to be aware that while Nintendo doesn't sell your data to third parties, they do say they can share your data with some third parties for things such as advertising, which is pretty "
"normal. They also say they may collect information about you from other sources, including sources that sell information. And if you log into your social media through your Nintendo, they say they "
"may collect information from these third parties. Finally, some of the games you play on the Switch made by other companies might be collecting and sharing your data, so keep an eye on that. Overall"
" we're not too worried about Nintendo. Still, it’s always good to <a id=\"a1\">opt-out</a> of data sharing when you can."
