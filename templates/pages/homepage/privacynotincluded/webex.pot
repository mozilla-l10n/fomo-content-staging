"Webex is a video call app made by Cisco targeted at business users. It did beef up its free version when the pandemic hit in 2020. The free version offers up to 100 participants per call and "
"meetings as long as 50 minutes. Webex offers the standard fare of video call app features – high quality video and audio, downloads on desktop or mobile app or access through a browser, screen "
"sharing and recording, and the like. Webex is used by many healthcare businesses as it can be compliant with US HIPAA medical privacy laws. Cisco Webex also touts their pioneering use of artificial "
"intelligence in their video conferencing product to do things like facial recognition, meeting transcription, and an in-meeting AI personal assistant."

"Webex by Cisco seems to put a strong emphasis on security with its products. For a product that's used frequently by financial and healthcare providers and can be HIPAA compliant, that is a good "
"thing. End-to-end encryption isn’t enabled by default, so good to enable that, even though it will cause some features to not work. Webex has had a few known security vulnerabilities pop up. "
"Fortunately, it looks like the company was responsive when these vulnerabilities were discovered and quick to push a fix out to their users. They do say they can collect a fair amount of data, as "
"most of these video call apps outside of the privacy focused apps seem to do. They say they won’t sell this data but they can share it with other Cisco businesses as well as third-parties and "
"contractors. And we found the password requirement for free users is weaker than for business users, so if you're using the free version of WebEx, it's probably still wise to make your password "
"something really long and complicated like \"iMNotW3aringpAnyPanTsiNThisM33ting!\" or something like that."
