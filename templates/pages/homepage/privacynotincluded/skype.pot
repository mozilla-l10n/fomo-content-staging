"Before video call features came standard on mobile phones (shoot, almost before mobile phones), there was Skype. Launched in 2003, the former king of video calls has added features in an effort to "
"keep up with the booming video call competition — recently they even partnered with the new Space Jam movie so you could have Lebron James in your background. Skype lets users blur their background "
"for extra privacy, use real-time language translation and unlike some of the other apps on our list, call regular phone numbers. The video call app is owned by Microsoft these days, which means "
"Skype integrates with services like Microsoft Teams."

"Skype has had some privacy concerns in the past, most notably when it came to light that Microsoft, which owns Skype, allowed contract workers in China to listen in to Skype calls with \"no security"
" measures\" in place. It has since changed this practice, but it is a good reminder that even companies with decent security practices can handle your private data and conversations sloppily. "
"Because Skype has been popular for a number of years, it has become a target for malware and phishing attacks. Users are able to set up two-factor authentication on Skype, which we recommend to help"
" keep that conversation you're having with Grandma from being invaded by some angry troll. Skype doesn't use the stronger end-to-end encryption on phone or video calls, which, boo! Users can protect"
" their text chats by enabling “private conversations.” Microsoft does collect a fair amount of data and says they may share this with third-parties like Facebook and Verizon for advertising "
"purposes. It also says it combines data with third-parties such as data brokers, which can include your location. This isn't great. It’s also, unfortunately, not uncommon."
