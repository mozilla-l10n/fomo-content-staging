"\"Show, don't tell,\" the saying goes. Amazon's Echo Show video smart display takes that to heart. Just ask Alexa to show you the latest Netflix show you're binging, that recipe you're making, the "
"lyrics to the song you're listening to, your photos, weather forecasts, the news, your security cams, even video chat with Grandma. And now you don't just get to wonder if Alexa is always listening "
"to you, you get to wonder if she's watching you as well."

"Amazon proudly states they are not in the business of selling your personal information to others, which is good. However, a good question to ask is, why would Amazon need to sell your data when "
"they have their own advertising and retail juggernaut to use your data to sell you more stuff? Because Amazon is in the business of selling you more stuff. This means Amazon collects a whole lot of "
"data on you -- records of your shopping habits, Alexa search requests, the music you stream, the podcasts you listen to, when you turn your lights on and off, when you lock your doors, and on and on"

"What's good with Alexa? They make it possible to <a id=\"a1\">automatically delete voice recordings</a> immediately after they are processed. That's a nice feature after the controversy around <a "

"triggered. So, if you buy a pregnancy test through Amazon Alexa, they won't forget you bought that pregnancy test just because you ask them to delete the voice recording of that purchase. That "
