"When we select which apps to review for a guide like this, something we look for are apps that are highly recommended by consumer publications. The Sprout Pregnancy app was recommended in 2022 by "
"both <a id=\"a1\">Cosmopolitan</a> and <a id=\"a2\">Forbes</a>. Based on these positive reviews and the fact that the app has over one million downloads in the <a id=\"a3\">Google Play store</a>, we"
" included this app in our list to research. Which is why we were quite surprised that we weren't able to find a privacy policy at all for the Sprout Pregnancy app. On top of that, the company that "
"makes the app never responded to our multiple emails trying to get answers to our privacy questions. This is all very bad for an app that lets you build a \"personalized pregnancy timeline\" and "
"collects information like weight, doctor appointments, birth plan, and a pregnancy journal. A pregnancy app that collects so much very personal information should take privacy quite seriously. The "
"fact the Sprout Pregnancy app doesn't have a privacy policy indicates to us it does not."

"Well, this isn't good. It's terrible in fact. It seems the Sprout Pregnancy app doesn't have a privacy policy. Yup, an app that potentially collects lots of personal information about you, your "
"body, and your life doesn't care enough about your privacy to have a privacy policy. All we were able to find for the Sprout Pregnancy app was a Terms of Service doc last updated in September, 2013 "
"that had a very brief section called \"Use of Collected Data\" that didn't really contain much useful information. This is an automatic <i>*Privacy Not Included</i> for us. Please do not use this "
"app. Please never use an app that doesn't have a privacy policy."

"Weirdly, of the other apps Sprout makes — Spout Fertility &amp; Period Tracker, Sprout Baby, and Sprout Care — Sprout Pregnancy is the only app of theirs that doesn't have a privacy policy. The "
"others do, even if they haven't been updated recently. What's up with Sprout Pregnancy? We're just not sure. So again, please don't use this app. We can't even tell what could go wrong because we "
"have no idea what data they collect and how they use it. Bad, bad, BAD!"
