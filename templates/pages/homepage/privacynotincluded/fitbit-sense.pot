"Always wanted an Apple Watch for all the cool health tracking and smart watch features but don't have and iPhone. Fitbit made their new Sense health and fitness tracker for you. This busy little "
"watch measures your heart with an ECG, your blood oxygen levels, your stress through your skin temperature and electrodermal activity, how well (or not well) you are sleeping, it tracks your "
"menstrual cycle, and more. It'll also track you with GPS, count your steps and calories and active minutes. The Sense literally knows when you are sleeping and knows when you are awake and knows if "
"you've been bad or good. Santa, we see you."

"As of January 14, 2021, Google officially <a id=\"a1\">became the owner</a> of Fitbit. That worried many privacy conscious users. However, Google promised that “Fitbit users’ health and wellness "
"data won't be used for Google ads and this data will be kept separate from other Google ad data” as part of the deal with global regulators when they bought Fitbit. This is good."

"And Fitbit seems to do an OK job with privacy and security. It de-identifies the data it collects so it's (hopefully) not personally identifiable. We say hopefully because, depending on the kind of "
"data, it’s <a id=\"a1\">been found</a> to be pretty easy to de-anonymize these data sets and track down an individual’s patterns, especially with location data. So, be aware with Fitbit—or any "
"fitness tracker—you are strapping on a device that tracks your location, heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. That's a lot of personal information gathered in one place."

"What is not good is what can happen with all this very personal health data if others aren't careful. A recent <a id=\"a1\">report</a> showed that health data for over 61 million fitness tracker "
"users, including both Fitbit and Apple, was exposed when a third party company that allowed users to sync their health data from their fitness trackers did not secure the data properly. Personal "
"information such as names, birthdates, weight, height, gender, and geographical location for Fitbit and other fitness tracker users was left exposed because the company didn't password protect or "
"encrypt their database. This is a great reminder that yes, while Fitbit might do a good job with their own security, anytime you sync or share that data with anyone else, it could be vulnerable. And"
" Fitbit partners with many third parties such as employers and insurance companies. I don’t know about you, but I don’t need the world to know my weight and where I live. That’s really dang creepy."
