"Amazon proudly states they are not in the business of selling your personal information to others, which is good. However, a good question to ask is, why would Amazon need to sell your data when "
"they have their own advertising and retail juggernaut to use your data to sell you more stuff? This means Amazon collects a whole lot of data on you — records of your TV viewing habits, shopping "
"habits, Alexa search requests, the music you stream, the podcasts you listen to, when you turn your lights on and off, when you lock your doors, and on and on and on. And Amazon's Fire TV can "

"Amazon Fire HD tablets, of course, come with Alexa always happy to help if you chose to enable the AI. What's good with Alexa? They make it possible to <a id=\"a1\">automatically delete voice "

"when you delete your voice recordings, they still can keep data of the interactions those recordings triggered. So, if you buy a pregnancy test through Amazon Alexa, they won't forget you bought "
"that pregnancy test just because you ask them to delete the voice recording of that purchase. That record of the purchase is data they have on you going forward and may use to target you with ads "
