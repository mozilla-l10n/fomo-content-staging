"Stressed out? Overwhelmed? Neck in knots? Stomach a mess? Garmin's fitness trackers have you covered. They do all the usual fitness tracking stuff like activity, heart rate, sleep monitoring and "
"more. They also track the time interval between each heartbeat and use that to figure out how stressed you are. If you get too stressed, they will vibrate and remind you to take a moment to breath. "
"Deep breath everyone, this sounds like just what we need these days."

"Update: In June 2022, after Roe vs Wade was overturned allowing US states to make access to abortion illegal, we took another look at the privacy and security of the Garmin Watch as a device that "
"can track menstrual cycle and reproductive health data. Our updated review is below. Overall, Garmin does a pretty good job of protecting their users privacy and security and has a pretty good "
"history as standing up to law enforcement requests for their users' data."
