"While it is nice to have an e-reader option that is not tied to Amazon and all the data Amazon collects, it doesn't mean you're off the hook when it comes to data collection with Kobo's e-readers. "
"Kobe says they may sell your online identifiers and information about your online activity. Thatâ€™s bad. Kobo may also share your personal information with third parties for marketing and other "
"purposes. And, we're not sure you can even delete the data they collect on you if you live outside of California in the US or the European Economic Area where special privacy regulations are in "
"place. Kobo says you can request that data they have on you be corrected but there is no mention of any way to delete your data in their privacy policy. Hard to believe, but Kobo makes Amazon sound "
