"WeChat is a hugely popular social media and messaging app owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent. And when we say popular, we mean it’s one of the most downloaded apps in the world, with over a billion"
" active users. It’s also one of the least private messaging apps we've come across. It offers all the features -- text chat, video and voice chat, location sharing, stickers, games, WeChat Pay, and "
"even ways to exercise with your friends. Which is great. Just don't expect anything you do on WeChat to be private."

"Ding! Ding! Ding! WeChat earns our *Privacy Not Included warning label for good reason. WeChat isn't just bad at privacy, it's scary. Where to start? The lack of end-to-end encryption? Not a deal "
"breaker, but not great.The leak of hundreds of millions of private chat logs? Definitely bad! The reported recent banning of LGBTQ friendly and feminist accounts? Yikes! The alleged foreign "
"surveillance and censorship. Terrible! Yes, WeChat has a huge billion+ user base. Yes, it’s very popular and feature rich. But none of that outweighs WeChat's bad track record on privacy and "
"security. The bottom line: we feel the only way to protect your privacy when using WeChat, is to never use WeChat. *Privacy is absolutely not included."

"WeChat may hand over any data (including communication content) to the government, public, regulatory, judicial and law enforcement bodies or authorities when necessary. In addition, WeChat data can"

"International Pte Ltd (located in Singapore) and Oriental Power Holdings Limited (located in Hong Kong) and WeChat International (Canada) Limited (located in Canada). WeChat also says they may share"
" user data with a number of third parties. All WeChat users should note, Tencent also operates Weixin, a service interoperable with WeChat, targeted at users in mainland China. In the WeChat privacy"
" policy, they state, \"When you interact with a Weixin user, or use or receive notifications from any feature operated by Weixin, please be mindful that your information may be collected, retained, "
"shared and/or stored by Weixin in accordance with the Weixin Privacy Protection Guidelines and not this Privacy Policy.\" So if you as a WeChat user interact with a Weixin user (and you may not know"
" who on the service is a Weixin users versus a WeChat user), your privacy rights will be only protected as far as the less protective Weixin privacy policy applies."

"WeChat says that you can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions. The company provides clear "
"retention periods for all data. According to a 2019 paper by MIT researchers, at the time, when a user deleted a voice or text message, rather than removing the data from the local database, WeChat "
"simply removed the key storage for the data. However, because this data remained in the local storage, the data was not actually deleted. WeChat has indicated that currently, when a user deletes a "
"message from a chat, the WeChat app will immediately delete both the message key and the content of that message from the user’s local storage."

"WeChat allegedly censors private conversations automatically in real life, for both Chinese and non-Chinese users. In March 2019, a database of 364 million records of users from China was discovered"

"device being used. The database also sent data back to 17 remote servers in different provinces in China. There is a suspicion that the data gets distributed among police stations. WeChat also "
