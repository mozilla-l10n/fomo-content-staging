"Tracking health biometrics has its merits. And wearing a watch 24/7 can be cumbersome. Oura makes a ring that tracks your health stats and aims to help you sleep better and feel better. And it seems"
" the rich and famous—from Prince Harry to the NBA, WNBA, and more—have taken a shine to this little ring. It tracks sleep, steps, calories, as well as heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, "
"inactive times, and even naps. Oura offers up not one but two privacy policies that cover everything from the device and app to a privacy policy for sharing data with your doctor, trainer, or coach."
