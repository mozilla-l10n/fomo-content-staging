"One day after the <a id=\"a1\">official results</a> of the German Federal Election 2021 were announced, the German public was already embroiled in a discussion about the outcome of the election. The"
" turnout from voters under the age of 25 came as a surprise to many election observers: Rather than sticking with the two former Volksparteien (people’s parties) CDU/CSU and SPD, the nearly 3 "

"In <a id=\"a1\">our past research</a>, we uncovered several TikTok accounts impersonating prominent German political institutions and figures, using the handles @derbundestag and "
"@frank.walter.steinmeier. These accounts are in clear violation of TikTok’s <a id=\"a2\">community guidelines</a>, which prohibit impersonating someone else or misleading users about an account’s "
"identity or purpose. Despite the fact that these two accounts attracted thousands of followers and likes for months, they were taken down by TikTok only weeks before the election.<br/><br/>In "
"addition, the journalists at Bayerischer Rundfunk <a id=\"a3\">discovered</a> a viral election-related TikTok video spreading misinformation about Alliance 90/The Greens, using the 1990s rap song "
"“Gangsta's Paradise.” The sound was used by more than 40 creators to produce similar videos, some of them gaining more than 1.8 million views. The plot and the setting of the video is always the "
"same: It is election night, the Greens have won, and they’re presenting new rules for life in Germany. Concerningly, 6 out of 7 statements in the video have been debunked as false claims by "
"independent fact checkers. Such videos may fall under TikTok’s <a id=\"a4\">rules</a> banning misinformation, but the problem was not addressed by the platform.<br/><br/> There are limitations to "
"conducting large-scale, quantitative research into TikTok. Because the platform does not currently provide any comprehensive transparency tools or an API, researchers must develop new methodologies "
"and technical infrastructure in order to identify patterns of harm or abuse. Mozilla’s <a id=\"a5\">past research in the US</a>, for instance, involved a mix of manually looking through relevant "
"hashtags, accounts, and videos and querying an unofficial API to uncover issues on the platform. The researchers at ISD built a dataset of 1,030 TikTok videos as part of <a id=\"a6\">their research "
"into hate speech and extremism</a> on the platform. The <a id=\"a7\">WSJ’s video investigation</a> was based on a large dataset of TikTok videos using 100 automated accounts."

"Another question arose during the experiment: Could TikTok’s automated system for detecting bots be interfering with the outcomes of the experiment? TikTok’s <a id=\"a1\">2020 Transparency "
"Report</a> reported on how many inauthentic accounts were removed in 2020, so we know the platform has technical tools in place to identify inauthentic behavior. Throughout the experiment, ATI "
"observed and ran into aspects of TikTok’s automated system for identifying inauthentic activity, but so far the agents have been operating as planned without issues. However, it’s difficult to know "
"to what degree TikTok detected the agents and is taking steps to limit their engagement."

"As we’ve shown in this report, researchers and journalists seeking to study the TikTok platform will run into lots of challenges. TikTok currently does not provide any transparency tools or APIs to "
"researchers seeking to study the platform. Without such tools, it is nearly impossible for researchers to look “under the hood” of the TikTok algorithm and identify patterns of abuse or harm. We "
"therefore urge TikTok to develop meaningful transparency tools and archives to empower civil society oversight."

"Specifically, <b>TikTok should release tools to empower public interest researchers and journalists to study the TikTok algorithm.</b> That could include a public API researchers can query, a tool "
"that simulates how the FYP feed works, or comprehensive transparency reports and archives. For instance, Twitter has a publicly available API and <a id=\"a1\">recently released a version of the API "
"for academic researchers</a> that features more precise filtering options."

"In addition, <b>TikTok should develop a publicly-accessible library or repository of all ads, branded content, and promotions running on the platform</b>, as other platforms have done to varying "
"degrees (see: <a id=\"a1\">Facebook Ad Library</a>, <a id=\"a2\">Snap Political Ad Library</a>, <a id=\"a3\">Google Transparency Report</a>). TikTok should follow Mozilla’s <a "
"id=\"a4\">guidelines</a> when designing this repository and ensure that it includes content from all advertisements running on the platform, including paid partnerships. This will enable community "
"oversight of TikTok’s policy enforcement and support independent research into the online advertising ecosystem."

"With an ever-growing user base and skyrocketing revenue, TikTok is on course to define the next era of social media. And yet our research demonstrates that there is a major transparency gap on "
"TikTok. With the platform increasingly falling behind its peers, we urge TikTok to develop meaningful transparency tools like an API or an ad archive to empower civil society oversight of the "
"platform."
