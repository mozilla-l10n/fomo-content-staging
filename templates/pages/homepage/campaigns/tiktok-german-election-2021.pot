"reputation for viral songs and silly dances,<a id=\"a3\"> various studies</a> have shown that politics and political groups have a strong presence on TikTok. This is certainly true for TikTok in "
"Germany, where in recent months <a id=\"a4\">parties</a> and <a id=\"a5\">politicians</a> have flocked to the platform. Mozilla’s <a id=\"a6\">past research into political advertising on TikTok</a> "
