"Electoral campaigns are fought increasingly online, especially in pandemic times. Germany is no exception. And while the German campaign was more civil than, say, the U.S. presidential elections "
"last year, it has faced similar problems when it comes to how campaigns played out on online platforms: Candidates, especially<a id=\"a1\"> those running</a><a id=\"a2\"> for Chancellor</a>, were "
"confronted with hate and false statements about their character. Meanwhile, public authorities were concerned about foreign interference (<a id=\"a3\"> rightfully so</a>). Right-wing networks of "
"groups and users on social media were found to<a id=\"a4\"> inflate the popularity</a> of certain content. And social media again was<a id=\"a5\"> rife with disinformation</a> – not only regarding "
"Covid-19, vaccines, and climate change, but also relating to the positions of political parties and candidates as well as the integrity of the electoral process itself. Potential effects were "
"already evident in the run-up to the election. For instance,<a id=\"a6\"> one survey found</a> that 28 and 23 percent of respondents in Germany, respectively, incorrectly believed that the Green "

"But there were important differences between how these two elections played out. For instance, platforms didn’t impose any temporary bans on political advertising in the run-up to the election in "
