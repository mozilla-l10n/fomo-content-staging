"This initiative aims to support local innovation approaches that are empowering and inclusive of African stakeholders. Last year, we supported an event convened by Lawyer’s Hub titled <a "
"id=\"a1\">“White Capital, Black Founders”</a> that interrogated how race, nationality, and class biases limit the opportunities available to African innovators by foreign companies and investors. "
"This was followed by a <a id=\"a2\">pan-African study</a> conducted by AfriLabs on the key challenges faced by African technology entrepreneurs, that range from access to capital, legal and policy "
"barriers, cross border collaboration, to competition as it relates to closed platforms. Meanwhile, Indian regulators have <a id=\"a3\">increased</a> <a id=\"a4\">policy</a> <a id=\"a5\">activity</a>"
" aimed at cultivating ‘national champions’ as well as promoting the idea of ‘self-reliant’ Indian consumer technology ecosystem as a challenge to Silicon Valley market dominance. Notably, this wave "
"of policy has received push back from both civil society and some sections of the start-up community who argue these moves could potentially <a id=\"a6\">entrench</a> concentration of power among "
"select domestic business elites, and risk replicating concerns with Silicon Valley business models."

"Expanding on <a id=\"a1\">Mozilla’s Reimagine Open</a> project, the <i>Powering Local Innovation</i> initiative will also explore how and if foundational principles of openness can be applied to "
"innovation ecosystems in the Global South. Mitchell Baker, CEO of Mozilla Corporation, has advocated that the concept of \"open\" should not be co-opted by systems and companies that don't uphold "
"the principles of access, empowerment, and opportunity that made the original open Internet so successful."
