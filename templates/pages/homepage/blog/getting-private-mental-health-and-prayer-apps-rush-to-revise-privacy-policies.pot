"We applaud the companies that have made changes in response to our *Privacy Not Included buyer’s guide and we hope others will follow. Mental health apps provide a vital service to millions of "
"people, particularly at this challenging time. Unfortunately, the changes we are witnessing show how these apps were, and sometimes still do, fail to protect their users. Offering mental health "
"services should not come at the expense of users’ personal information. We are glad that this crucial research is eliciting interest and real-time change."

"<b>Data sharing with third parties.</b> Recovery Record now clearly states that it won’t sell or share data with third parties for direct marketing purposes. This follows a review of their policy "
"dated May 2, 2022 where they removed vague consent caveats, such as: “unless we have your permission” and “for any purpose” referring to the use of aggregate data - data gathered from multiple "
"sources."

"<b>Now requiring strong passwords.</b> Hallow and Recovery Record apps have also changed their password requirements to at least eight characters and will flag weak, repetitive/sequential passwords."
" Before; Mozilla’s review noted that eight apps did not require strong passwords, ranging from “1” to “1111111”. Moodfit app still accepts a single-digit password."

"<b>Monitoring and responding to privacy concerns:</b> After a series of conversations between Mozilla and Calm, the company has updated its privacy policies and now grants all its users the right to"
" access and delete their data, regardless of their location. Modern Health and Breathe, Think, Do by Sesame apps acknowledged that they hadn’t been monitoring their email hotline for privacy-related"
" questions, but have started to do so. Woebot also referenced Mozilla’s findings and has worked to help clarify some of the confusing language in their privacy policy. They also now state in their "
"privacy policy that all users have the same rights to data access and deletion."
