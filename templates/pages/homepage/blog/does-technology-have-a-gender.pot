"Have you ever wondered if technology has a gender? And if it does, is it female or male? We can refer to technology being genderless, but often favors one gender over another. Women are often left "
"behind even though many technologies are given feminine names like Alexa and others, does this have any effect on technology? Creating integrated technology forces us to answer these questions and "
"find solutions to ensure technology does not leave any person or group behind."

"In voice technology, researchers have identified the existence of gender challenges, for example, voice technology does not represent everyone's voice and differences so sometimes these systems fail"
" to recognize certain sounds especially in terms of gender and different accents. What contributes to these challenges? In Mozilla's Common Voice project, we were able to address some of the "
"challenges that researchers have identified."

"Voice technologies recognize more men's voices than women's voices. This is also due to the lack of inclusive data that is gender sensitive. <a id=\"a1\">A research</a> by Tatman published by the "
"North American Chapter of the Computer Linguistics Association (NAACL) shows that Google speech recognition is 13% more accurate for men than women."

"Access and affordability of the Internet for different genders can also impact adaptation and use of technology, in developing countries many women are unable to access technology. Access comes in "
"two forms: access to devices and access to the technology, so they are unable to use the Internet. In many countries, especially in Africa, the cost of the internet and access devices are high, so "
"many women with low-incomes are forced to choose between eating or paying to connect to the internet. This is because many voice technology solutions require sufficient bandwidth which many cannot "
"afford."

"Gender-based harassment in AI bots, a study by Leah Fessler of Quartz's found that most AI bots responded either with gratitude or acceptance to sexually assaulting statements. This has changed in "
"2020 but <a id=\"a1\">still leaves a lot of room for building gender stereotypes</a>. The study revealed this after examining how Siri and Alexa responded to issues of sexual harassment and abuse."

"How many of us are aware of the gender statistics of teams of engineers and technicians who specialize in various technologies, especially voice? Can we say for example how many Google engineers are"
