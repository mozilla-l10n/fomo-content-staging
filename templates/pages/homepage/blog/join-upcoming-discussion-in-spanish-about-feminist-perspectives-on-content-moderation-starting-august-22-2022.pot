"Moderating online content has escalated into a public challenge, intrinsic to social media giants’ very existence. In the words of researcher and author Tarleton Gillespie, “a platform would not "

"Yet the idea of having our online discussions, behaviors and interactions “moderated” is often unsettling and tends to be subjective (according to moderators’ vision). Some users have been ‘too "

"Indeed, digital experiences often reflect traditional power relations from the offline world, ranging from the values that prevail to decision-makers belonging to dominant subgroups of the "
"population. As such, discussing content moderation from an intersectional feminist perspective, i.e considering how different forms of discrimination overlap online, can offer new perspectives on "
"building digital spaces for all the diversity of bodies and identities."

"There is a thin line between ensuring safe spaces and fighting violence through content moderation at scale vs. impinging on freedom of expression and/or mistakenly silencing population subgroups. "

"Together with EQUIS Justicia para las Mujeres, we are organizing a <a id=\"a1\">‘thematic cycle’ on Eureka</a> to discuss content moderation from a feminist perspective, and imagine what content "
"moderation guidelines feminist online spaces should operate under. Based on a selection including two documentaries, and a few book chapters, we will discuss key questions such as: What is content "
"moderation and who implements it? How is content moderation reproducing and even fueling misogyny and discrimination? And critically: how can current practices be improved, considering both the need"
" to limit online violence and protect freedom of expression?"

"Content moderation can be defined as “the process of deciding what stays online and what gets taken down” (Who Moderates the Social Media Giants?, NYU, 2020). It implies the classification of all "
"content produced on social media into acceptable content (social and cultural commentary, pet pics, day-to-day commentary) vs. unacceptable content (sex content, violent content, unlawful content, "
"hate speech). That being said, some content falls into a gray area, such as health content, political commentary, and misinformation (Marianne Díaz Hernández, MozFest, March 2021)."

"The process in itself is not new. As York (2020) puts it, “throughout history, various bodies have imposed rules on what ordinary citizens can see or say,” often known as “censorship.” The author "
"argues that “censorship is in itself an inherently value-neutral term,” but often used to describe only “the restrictions of which we disapprove” (such as insulting country leaders) vs. the ones we "
"approve (such as child sexual exploitation imagery)."

"Historically, nation-states have been the gatekeepers of speech and often “the more democratic a state, the more transparent it is when it comes to censorship” (York, 2020). At the international "
"level, there are guidelines and agreements aiming to protect freedom of expression, and helping define what is not tolerated under it, such as hate speech. That being said, over the past 20 years, "
"we have moved into an “information regime” (Byung-Chul Han, Infocracy, 2022), in which owning unprecedented amounts of information is one of the key determinants of economic and sociopolitical "
"power. The major ‘tech’ companies, including social media giants, grew exponentially by exploiting ‘big data.’ Today, they largely dominate the digital market in most countries which has effectively"
" turned them into the new “gatekeepers of speech” (York, 2020)."
