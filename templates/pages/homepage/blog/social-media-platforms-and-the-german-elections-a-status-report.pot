"We’ve already sounded the alarm bell about inaction by Big Tech ahead of the election. In August, we showed that social media companies had yet to make any substantial policy changes before this "
"election in Germany. This is surprising, given our evolving understanding of the threat of election disinformation, and the strong public sense that platforms have a responsibility to contribute to "
"election integrity following the contentious US election. Comparing their collective approach ahead of the German elections to the measures platforms put in place around the U.S. election, it‘s "
"clear that they are not exerting the same effort for an election that isn't on their doorstep, and where English isn’t the primary language."

"There are undeniably important differences between the U.S. and German elections. In the US, disinformation occupied a central role in the coverage of the election and its aftermath, not least "
"because much of it stemmed from or was amplified by one of the candidates. While this isn’t the case to the same extent in Germany, the potential impact of election disinformation remains "
"significant, and the platforms’ continuing lack of transparency makes understanding the impact of their policies particularly difficult."

"With no insight into what has – or hasn’t – worked, it remains difficult to hold platforms accountable for what policies should be implemented. And experience has shown that in absence of public "
"scrutiny and pressure, the platforms are reluctant to adopt sufficient protections on their own. Germans watched last year’s U.S. elections intensely. They are concerned about how social media "
"misinformation could warp their own election’s outcome."
