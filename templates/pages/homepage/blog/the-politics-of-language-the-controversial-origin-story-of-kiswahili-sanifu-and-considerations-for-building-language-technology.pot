"Kiswahili is Africa’s most spoken language and in the <a id=\"a1\">top 10 most widely spoken</a> languages in the world. With more than 200 million speakers already, interest in the language will "
"likely increase, with the United Nations recently declaring 7 July as the <a id=\"a2\">World Kiswahili language day</a> - the first African language to be recognised in this way. Yet even as the "
"language proliferates, its origin story is still greatly debated and the colonial influences apparent in this origin story often overlooked."

"Given our efforts to build a Kiswahili dataset on <a id=\"a1\">Mozilla Common Voice</a>, as well as training automatic speech recognition models for the language, we sought to engage a team of "
"Kiswahili linguists and language experts. Between September and November of 2021, we organised a “Linguists’ Engagement” seeking to interrogate whether linguistics studies of the language have "
"codified the diversity of different Kiswahili speakers. Our main intention from the interaction was to learn what key factors of the language we would need to keep in mind to ensure our work is "
"inclusive and able to serve the diversity of Kiswahili speakers that exists. It greatly surprised us that beyond identifying accents, dialects and language variants, the colonial history of the East"
" African coast as well as the history of the Swahili people and the Kiswahili language presented socio-linguistic learnings that are now core to how we view inclusive building of the Kiswahili "
"dataset on Common Voice."

"The<b> first</b> is that <a id=\"a1\">Kiswahili is a pidgin, or creole, of Arabic and Bantu languages</a> and that it came about when the Arabs came to Eastern Africa (EA) for trade purposes and "
"began interacting with locals, who were Bantu speakers, in the 19th century. As author Francis Nesbitt <a id=\"a2\">writes</a>:"

"Further to this theory, is that Kiswahili is a pidgin or a mixture that includes several other languages; Portuguese, Indian and Persian, as these are some of the other nationalities that were "
"present along the EA coast, at the same time, for trading purposes. The language has a significant number of borrowed words, which supports this theory; ‘meza’, the Kiswahili word for table, is of "
"Portuguese origin and ‘chapati’ is a Kiswahili word of Indian origin."

"A<b> second theory</b> states that the term 'Kiswahili' is of Arabic origin, while the language itself is Bantu. That when the Arabs came to EA and found those living there, along the coast, they "
"referred to them as 'Saheel', which is Arabic for ‘the coast’, and that over time this term evolved to become Kiswahili for the language and Swahili (or Waswahili in plural), referencing the people."
" <a id=\"a1\">Evidence of Kiswahili as a Bantu language</a> dates back to as early as the 2nd century AD in a document called 'Periplus of Erythrean Sea' written by an anonymous Greek author "
"detailing the early expansion of Swahili civilisations towards Somalia, Kenya and Zanzibar."

"The Standard Kiswahili, or Kiswahili Sanifu, we know today was created through the standardisation of a dialect known as Kiunguja, which originated from the Zanzibar and Pemba Islands of Tanzania. "
"Kiunguja is one of over 23 known dialects of Kiswahili. In the book ‘Machozi Yameniishia’, the poet Mohammed Ghassani, is critical of the choice of Kiunguja as the basis for Kiswahili Sanifu, and "
"many Kiswahili writers and academics share this sentiment. The process was entirely owned by colonial authorities without the involvement of native speakers."

"The efforts to standardise Kiswahili were driven by missionary groups. On one hand, German missionaries who were keen on using the dialects from Mombasa (Kenya), Pate (Kenya) and Tanga (Tanzania), "
"which are areas where they were stationed. On the other hand, English missionaries were keen on using Kiunguja because it was the language where they were stationed, in Zanzibar and neighbouring "
"islands, and therefore the language/dialect they were most familiar with. In 1930 the Inter-territorial Language Committee chose the Zanzibari Kiswahili dialect, Kiunguja, as the source of Standard "
"Kiswahili, a decision influenced by British colonial rule over East African territories."

"To ensure the propagation of Kiswahili Sanifu, the Inter-territorial Language (Kiswahili) Committee, made up entirely of Europeans, would approve textbooks used to teach the language in schools. "
"Textbooks were written and reviewed by Europeans and through this, vocabulary changed with some words being shortened and their meaning completely changing. Therefore, the more this language was "
"standardised, the further it drifted away from what native Kiswahili speakers knew as Kiunguja. Some see the standardisation as a tool, once again for the coloniser, to massacre other dialects. Its "
"use and calculated propagation in schools resulted in the reduced use of other related dialects and in a phenomenon known as ‘Linguistic Insecurity’. <a id=\"a1\">Write</a> authors Wilma Bucci and "

"Post-independence, Kiswahili Sanifu has been largely ratified by local populations. It has been used as a national language in Tanzania, Kenya, the DRC and Uganda. It is an official language of the "
"East African Community (EAC) as well as the Southern African Development Community (SADC). In Tanzania, it is used as the medium of instruction in schools. The language has enjoyed great government "
"support in the region, particularly in Tanzania. One of the greatest contributions of Julius Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania, was to push for the growth of Kiswahili in East and Central "
"Africa as he believed that it could promote African unity, as it had done in Tanzania. Kiswahili scholars in EA continue to actively grow the language with literature departments at universities and"
" research bodies continuing to publish new editions of Kiswahili dictionaries. Language bodies such as Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa (BAKITA) in Tanzania and Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa (CHAKITA) "
"in Kenya are responsible for the promotion of the Kiswahili language and publishing houses, notably in Tanzania, contribute to a growing body of literary works in circulation in the language."
