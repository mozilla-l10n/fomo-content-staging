"It was refreshing, and frankly shocking, to witness just how intertwined industry and government are in Rwanda and how much access these groups have to each other. We learnt that government support "
"of the project led to obtaining access to over 3 million sentences in Kinyarwanda, and this has been key to the success of the project."

"Additionally, we had a government representative attend the pitch session at the hackathon and participate as a judge. There was a lot of constructive feedback, suggestions to improve the "

"The launch of the Kinyarwanda Deep Speech API is a significant milestone. It is however not the end of the road. The Digital Umuganda team acknowledges that there was still a lot of work that needs "
"to be done to improve the error rate of the published model. Part of this effort needs to be intentionality in diversifying the dataset in terms of contributors."

"The 2000+ hours of Kinyarwanda data made available on the Common Voice platform has been contributed by a community of about 1000 people and this may be one of the reasons for the high error rate, "

"The story of Digital Umuganda is both a positive example and a cautionary tale. It is exemplary that a start-up has owned and driven the activities around data collection, model training and finally"
" making available these APIs for general public use. They have also played a key role in the country in the time of the pandemic through Mbaza, a chatbot made accessible via USSD, that gives "
"critical information related to the Covid-19 pandemic. They have generated revenue in the millions of dollars for the telcos hosting the service. However, most of this revenue goes directly to the "
"telco…and here’s the cautionary part. This is a symptom of the support that startups need, beyond technical ability. The know-how to identify a market and figure out a revenue model that can sustain"
