"I expect that many of you have had the chance to use programs such as Google Translate which have been created for this task. When I was a French student, I relied a lot on Google Translate, "
"especially in my homework that needed me to write or to read French stories or in speaking exercises with my classmates. When reading, whenever I encountered a word that I did not recognise, it was "
"easy to type it on the web platform and get a translation. And when it came to speaking, it was easier for me to think in English then translate to French, so when I wanted to use a word whose "
"translation I did not know, I would also type it up and get what I needed."

"This ease of translation is not equal among the languages of the world. Particularly when we get to African languages, there is a lot that is missing. Recently, I have had a desire to advance my "
"proficiency in my mother tongue, which is one of the Luhya languages. I am saddened by the lack of tools that would make my efforts easier, as in the French scenario."

"Kiswahili is one of thirteen African languages available on Google Translate. It is a language with many speakers, approximately between one hundred million and one hundred and fifty million. It is "
"this state that gives the language an advantage on digital platforms as technology companies focus on and build software that they believe will be used by many people. Beyond the number of speakers,"
" we find that Kiswahili is better resourced than other languages, particularly when it comes to digital tools. We also find that the performance of these tools is better for Kiswahili, as with other"
" languages that have more resources. This status has contributed towards the focus on Kiswahili in language technology and in the research to advance these technologies."

"It is important to understand that the existence of these translation software does not mean that they cannot make mistakes. Tasks that require the ability to think, meaning those that are done by "
"human beings, are hard to ape. Computer Science experts working in topics involving the replication of human intelligence, a field known as Artificial Intelligence, make advances everyday towards "
"this ability to ape human intelligence but the technology has not advanced to a point of being able to think like humans or to replace us."
