"They follow you around as you go from one website to another and store all the information you leave behind. On their own, each data point says very little about you. But when you combine all that "
"information, it suddenly becomes possible to gain insight into your political beliefs, your religion, gender, sexual preferences, financial status, and even whether you are about to get married or "
"want to get pregnant. And that’s exactly what happens: data brokers use the information they collect to build extensive, although often incorrect, profiles."

"And it gets worse. A lot of these decisions are made by machines that use complicated algorithms to decide whether or not you are eligible for a loan. So complex that it’s often impossible for a "

"The convoluted nature of these algorithms means it’s easy for bias or outright discrimination to seep in and stay hidden. In many countries it’s illegal to discriminate on the basis of "
"characteristics like race, age, gender or religion. But companies can (and do) sneak in discrimination through the back door by using proxies for these characteristics. For example, your choice of "
"social media platform reveals a lot about your age."
