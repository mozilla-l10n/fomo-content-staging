"members of civil society bodies, a recently published anthology shows."

"This anthology shows the extent to which techno-solutionism tends to validate the use of abusive technology. A state that assumes the people it governs are potential criminals is a state that relies"

"Mexico is ranked as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists in Latin America. This treatment enables a silencing chamber that leaves countless residents in the dark, uninformed or "
"misinformed. “Legitimate use of force” through technology directly breaches fundamental rights such as privacy, freedom of expression, or the right to information."
