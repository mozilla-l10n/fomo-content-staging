"You’re probably aware that companies and governments collect data about you, like your name and where you live. But your digital profile isn’t based only on the data you choose to share, all sorts "

"Algorithmic decision-making can carry more weight than you might expect. While algorithms do innocuous or helpful things like changing the traffic signals when you approach an intersection, they "

"for insurance."

"The first layer is the one we control ourselves – it’s information that we often give voluntarily when we use computers, phones, or anything else connected to the internet: your username, your real "
"name, your photos, your friends, your likes, what you search for, who you’ve blocked from your contacts. In most cases, you can choose not to share this type of data through a combination of opting "
"out, avoiding data-hungry platforms and deleting your activity history, but doing so will require constant attention and self-control. It’s a rather difficult task if you simply want to live part of"
" your life online with some degree of spontaneity."

"They can learn more by comparing the data they collected about you from layers 1 and 2 with data they’ve collected from others, and establishing patterns in that information. Machines make "
"assumptions and predictions about you based on statistics. They use all the prior “knowledge” gathered about you, as well as observations made about your friends, or people similar to you, to "
